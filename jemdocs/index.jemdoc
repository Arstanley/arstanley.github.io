== Bio
#Tyler Derr is an Assistant Professor in the [https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/cs/ Department of Computer Science], Teaching and Affiliate Faculty in the [https://www.vanderbilt.edu/datascience/ Data Science Institute], and Faculty Fellow in the [https://www.vanderbilt.edu/autismandinnovation/ Frist Center for Autism and Innovation] at [https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ Vanderbilt University]. He received his PhD (2020) in Computer Science from Michigan State University under the supervision of [http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili Dr. Jiliang Tang] and was a member of the Data Science and Engineering (DSE) Lab and Teachers in Social Media (TISM) Project. He had complete his MS (2015) in Computer Science at The Pennsylvania State University and dual BS (2013) in Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences at The Pennsylvania State University.

Welcome! I am a PhD student at Vanderbilt University, working with Professor [https://tylersnetwork.github.io Tyler Derr]. I graduated from the University of Notre Dame with an honor Bachelor degree in 2021, where I worked at [https://www.meng-jiang.com/lab.html the Notre Dame DM2 Lab] with ["https://www.meng-jiang.com/" Prof. Meng Jiang] on data mining and anomaly detection. In the past, I have been fortunate to work with ["https://www3.nd.edu/~dwang5/" Prof. Dong Wang] in ["https://www3.nd.edu/~sslab/" the Notre Dame Social Sensing Lab]. Before starting my PhD, I was a software development engineer at Amazon Web Services. Please kindly find my attached [CV_Public.pdf CV]
